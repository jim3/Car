# Car Class Exercise

```
/*
Write a class named Car that has the following fields:

# yearModel: The yearModel is an int that holds the car's year model.
# make: The make field references a String object that holdes the make of the car.
# speed: The speed field is an int that holds the car's current speed.

In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other methods:
# Constructor: The constructor should accept the car's year model and make as arguments. These values
should be assigned to the object's yearModel and make fields. The constructor should assign 0 to the speed field.

# Accessors: Appropriate accessor methods should get the values stored in an object's yearModel, make, and speed fields.

# accelerate: The accelerate mthod should add 5 to the speed field each time it is called.
# brake: The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time it is called.

Pretty much my first attempt at OOP, you probably can't get much more of a beginner type of exercise than this. I took an exercise from a textbook called "Starting out with Java". One of my rules is I only get help from search engines or or forums if I can't get through a certain part and I think I might go "jump out the window" or something crazy like that. ðŸ˜† 

Write a class named Car that has the following fields:

* yearModel: The yearModel is an int that holds the car's year model.
*  make: The make field references a String object that holdes the make of the car. For example, Ford.
*  speed: The speed field is an int that holds the car's current speed.

In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other methods:

*  Constructor: The constructor should accept the car's year model and make as arguments. These values
should be assigned to the object's yearModel and make fields. The constructor should assign 0 to the speed field.
*  Accessors: Appropriate accessor methods should get the values stored in an object's yearModel, make, and speed fields. accelerate: The accelerate mthod should add 5 to the speed field each time it is called.
*  brake: The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time it is called.
